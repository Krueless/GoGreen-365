        The Sapling will be progressing towards responsible consumerism and wellness by:
        
        1. Reducing Single-Use Plastic. We are eschewing single-use plastics and other non-biodegradable materials in favour of eco-friendly alternatives for takeaway/delivery.
        2. Using Sustainable Source Ingredients. We support local produce and assess our suppliers based on sustainable practices.
        3. Creating Zero Food Waste Dishes. By repurposing our ingredients through an effective menu planning system, our dishes are created to use up all edible parts.
        4. Serving Wellness Cuisines. We care for your health and aim to provide balance, nutrient-dense foods with a focus on goodness of natural ingredients on your plate.
